# Instrumenting TAS OpenTelemetry for Spring Boot Application with Tanzu Observability or Wavefront 

The OpenTelemetry (OTel) agent for Java based Spring Boot application enables JMX profiling, tracing, eventing on any Java 8+ application, and dynamically injects bytecode to capture telemetry from a number of popular libraries and frameworks. This provides the ability to gather telemetry data from a Java application without code changes.
The OpenTelemetry Java agent uses `OTLP` exporter configured to send data to OpenTelemetry collector

For this demonstration, we've enabled the Spring Micrometer traces for a sample Spring Boot application through the OpenTelemetry Java agent that is available with the latest [Java buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git) `v4.66.0`.

Before using the buildpack to fetch the metrics, we must enable OpenTelemetry Collector agent on TAS under the Wavefront Nozzle tile settings.

## Configuring OTel on Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle

In this section, we'll configure OTel on Tanzu Observability (TO) by configuraing few parameters in TAS for the Wavefront tile.

1. On TAS for Wavefront tile, add the below settings in the `Config` section under **Wavefront Proxy Config** > **Custom Proxy Configuration** > **Custom**.
    ```bash
    otlpGrpcListenerPorts=4317
    otlpHttpListenerPorts=4318
    otlpResourceAttrsOnMetricsIncluded=true
    ```
1. Add a pre-processing rule under the `Preprocessor Rules` section under **Wavefront Proxy Config** > **Custom Proxy Configuration** > **Custom**.
    ```bash
    '4317':
    - rule    : drop_process_command
        action  : dropTag
        tag     : process.command_args
    ```

1.	Save the changes and click **Apply**.

## Deploying a Sample Spring Boot Application and Creating the Service for Otel-Collector

In the next step, we'll create a Spring Boot application with the java-buildpack (v4.66.0) that has the open-telemetry JAVA agent.

> **Note** We've used TAS 5.0.4 for this demonstration purpsoe.

The spring-music app is cloned from https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music in the jumpbox.  

1. Clone the spring-music app from [Github](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music) to jumpbox.

1. Go to the spring-music directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    $ cf push spring-music -f manifest.yml -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
    ```
1. To check the application status, run the following command:
    ```bash
    $ cf app spring-music

1. Create a user-provided service for the spring-music app and bind to it.
    ```bash
    $ cf cups spring-music-otel-collector -p '{"otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint":"http://wavefront-proxy.service.internal:4317","otel.exporter.otlp.metrics.temporality.preference":"delta","otel.resource.attributes":"application=spring-music,cluster=otel-test,shard=ap1","otel.traces.exporter":"otlp","otlp.metrics.exporter":"otlp","otel.exporter.otlp.protocol":"grpc","otel.service.name":"spring-music-svc","otel.jmx.target.system":"jetty,kafka-broker,tomcat","otel.javaagent.debug":"true"}'
    ```

    ```bash
    $ cf bind-service spring-music spring-music-otel-collector  && cf restage spring-music

    $ cf service spring-music-otel-collector

## Observing the Metrics in VMware Aria for Operations (Tanzu Observability)

For Spring micrometer traces for the application, the data is populated in the Spring Boot dashboard under the Tanzu Observability portal.

The telemetry data further enriches to provide tracing information, services call, operational tasks, and latency between the classes and system calls:

## Conclusion

- The current implementation helps in getting Spring Boot application tracing to TO tile from TAS through the wavefront proxy as existing TAS firehose doesnâ€™t allow existing tracing metrics from the platform.
- Using Open Telemetry Javaagent in the buildpack, the user can auto instrument most of the data required from the Spring Boot application without configuring them manually.
